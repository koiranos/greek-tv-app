## Introduction

This is an application to directly watch the major Greek TV channels.
React Framework along with Next.js were used to create the main application. The streaming service for each channel is given by the m3u8 file type apart from one that is using youtube live streaming.
For this reason two React Players were used, the react-hls-player from devchort and the react-player from CookPete.
The styling of the page was done with bootstrap and the solaris bootswatch theme.
