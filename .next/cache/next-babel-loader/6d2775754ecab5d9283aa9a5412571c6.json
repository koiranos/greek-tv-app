The only browser that has this capability is Safari. Another drawback is that we are using React and Next.js to our web application wich makes it a little bit harder to embed videos in html. For these reasons I chose react-hls-player and react-player. I could use one of them for my application but following the initial notion to use different approaches lead me to use them both.\"), __jsx(\"h3\", null, \"Styling\"), __jsx(\"p\", {\n    className: \"lead\"\n  }, \"For the styling of the page I used bootstrap and bootswatch.
