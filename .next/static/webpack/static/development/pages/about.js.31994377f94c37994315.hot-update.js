The video tag in most popular browsers does not support m3u8 files or the HLS protocol (Http Live Streaming) in general. The only browser that has this capability is Safari. Another drawback is that we are using React and Next.js to our web application wich makes it a little bit harder to embed videos in html. For these reasons I chose react-hls-player and react-player. I could use one of them for my application but following the initial notion to use different approaches lead me to use them both.")));
